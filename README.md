# Uniswap-Fork
An example project I made, deployed to Ganache, of a functional fork of Uniswap V2 (including front end and smart contracts).  I forked, and deployed all of Uniswap V2's contract with some subtle changes for my own example DEX, and then connected them to a basic front-end infrastructure, to create a functional DEX.
I then created a migration contract that could be used to bootstrap initial capital from Uniswap's token pools and have users transfer them into my DEX's pools - the same strategy used by Sushiswap. This project is a combination of tutorials I followed, and code I found which I combined into a final functional project of my own.
