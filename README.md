# Uniswap-Fork
An example project I made, deployed to a local Ganache Network, of a fork of Uniswap V2. I forked, and deployed all of Uniswap V2's contract for my own example DEX, and then connected them to a basic front-end infrastructure, to create a functional dex on Ganache. Additionally, I built in a migration contract that can be used to bootstrap capital from the original Uniswap into my DEX if I were to actually run this for real. This repo is a combination of a few tutorials I followed, and some some open-source projects I combined into one final functioning product.
